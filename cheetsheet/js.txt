data types in js
	undefined
	null
	boolean
	string
	symbol
	number
	object
variables are declared using
	var -> global variables
	let -> local variables
	const -> constant variables
statements are terminated with ; and block of statements are embedded inside{}
uninitialized variables has the value of undefined.
N/B: identifier namings uses the carmel syntax. the first word starts with 
     small letter and other words starts with capital letters
	e.g. myVariable; firstNum;

Escape keys in js
	\" ---> escapes double qoutes
	\' ---> escapes single qoutes
	\\ --->  adding a backslash
	\n --->  adding a new-line 
	\r ---> carriage return
	\t ---> tab
	\b ---> backspace
	\f---> form-feed
variable.length returns the number of characters of the given variable
strings are immutable meaning you cant change them once created but
you can replace them using assigning new value in the string.
arrays are declared using var/const/let and data enclosed in[]
myarray.push("text", 3); used to append data to an existing array.
myarray.pop(); used to remove the last element in the array. i.e. 3
myarray.shift(); used to remove the 1st element in the array. i.e. text
myarray.unshift(); used to add element in the first index of the array

functions helps to create reusable codes. syntax;
	function myFunction(parameters){
				statements;
				statements;
				return value;}

variables declared outside function blocks are visible  in the entire program.
i.e. they are globall variables declared using var keyword.
However, variables declared inside function blocks using var keyword are considered
as local variables. Inorder to change them to global variables while inside the 
function block, we just remove the var keywork.

Stand in line
A cue is an abstract data structure where items are kept in order. New items can
be added to the back of the cue while old items are taken off from the from of the cue.
This is achieved by using the .push() and .shift() array function.
N/B: The number of items in the array remains constant.

In javascript, there are two main operators for equality;
i.e. equality == and strict equality ===
equality (==) sign compares two or more values by trying to convert them into 1 equal data 
type before giving out the correct boolean answer. 
strict equality === sign compares two or more values strictly by checking both their
values and data type before returning the boolean output.
e.g. 3 === 3 returns true
     3 === '3' returns false 
     but
     3=='3' returns true
Also inequality operator != does type conversion but 
strict inequality operator !== does not perform type conversion
e.g. 2!= '5' returns true
     2!=='5' returns also returns true
Logical operators are the same as C.

Objects in javascript are same as dictionaries in python. They have key value pairs
embedded inside curly braces{} and same as declared as variables.Values can be 
accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.
Bracket notation are useful only when the property name of an object has a space between 
and also an integer property otherwise its recommended to use dot notation.
object.name returns the value of the object with the key name
object['name'] also returns the value of the object with the key name
