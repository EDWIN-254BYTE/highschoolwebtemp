# A HIGHSCHOOL WEBSITE TEMPLATE
---
A simple html template that can be used to create a highschool website. We created these project as a result of class assignment ðŸ˜‡. It has basic features of front-end that any newbie can understand.

### Technologies used are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT

We used these technologies so as to sharpen our front-end skills since it was our 1st ever project to build without using any tutorial assistance.
Also this project helped us learn more on how to work as a team using github.

### Challenges faced
- Implementing a carousel
- Choosing colors
- Responsiveness

### Future features to implement 
- Full responviness
- Better UI/UX
- Use sass
